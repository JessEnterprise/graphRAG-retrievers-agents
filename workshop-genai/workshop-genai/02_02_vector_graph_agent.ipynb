Risk Factors\\nThe Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can\\nbe affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described\\nbelow. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\\'s business,\\nreputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely\\naffected.\\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\\'s results of\\noperations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a\\nreliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate\\nresults or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking\\nstatements.\\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and\\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and the consolidated financial\\nstatements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary\\nData\" of this Form 10-K.\\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\\nThe Company\\'s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic\\nconditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s\\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the\\nCompany\\'s total net sales. In addition, the Company\\'s global supply chain is large and complex and\\na majority of the Company\\'s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are\\nlocated outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\\'s operations and performance depend\\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.\\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment,\\ninflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact\\nconsumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company\\'s\\nproducts and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely\\naffected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in\\nincome or asset values, and other economic factors.\\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\\'s products and services, uncertainty\\nabout, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the\\nCompany\\'s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network\\ncarriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability;\\ninability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the\\nCompany\\'s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions;\\nlimitations on the Company\\'s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair\\nvalues of the Company\\'s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely\\naffect the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\\nThe Company\\'s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes,\\nwar, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\\ninterruptions.\\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public\\nhealth issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international\\ncommerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and\\nits customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics '), Document(metadata={'risks': ['Geography', 'Geography',
